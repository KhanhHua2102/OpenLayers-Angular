# Openlayers implemented Angular Web Application

## About The Project

This web application is an implementation of the Openlayers map library in an Angular framework with TailwindCSS library on the frontend. The application is a map viewer that integrates environmental data sources, such as GeoJson file and Cloud GeoTiff (COG) APIs into the map viewer. The user interface is developed around the map and data, and methods for users to examine the data within the application.

## Data Sources
